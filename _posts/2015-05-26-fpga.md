## Abstract
We develop a new paradigm for designing fully streaming, area-efficient FPGA implementations of common vision algorithm building blocks. By focusing on avoiding redundant computation we are able to get 1-2 orders of magnitude reduction in design area utilization as compared to previous implementations. We demonstrate that our design works in practice by building five 325 frames per second high resolution Harris corner detection cores onto a single FPGA.
